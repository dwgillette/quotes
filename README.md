# quotes
A library of quotes for my first React app, a random quote generator. I initially created a GitHub 
account to host this library for my build on CodePen, but have since moved my projects to GitHub as well.
I really should move the file in this repository to the actualy quote machine's repository and update
the url in the app's code.
